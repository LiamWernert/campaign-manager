# TTRPG Campaign Manager

I had the idea for a sort of Census data generator for a Pathfinder 2e campaign I was creating some time ago and found that it was quite a small scope to make a whole application for and I've realised that I can do much more than just that

I want all the administrative and technical work of tabletop games to be sorted for the GM so they have as little to worry about as possible, so the end scope is incredibly broad at this point
