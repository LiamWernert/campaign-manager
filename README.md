# TTRPG Campaign Manager

I had the idea for a sort of Census data generator for a Pathfinder 2e campaign I was creating some time ago and found that it was quite a small scope to make a whole application for and I've realised that I can do much more than just that

I want all the administrative and technical work of tabletop games to be sorted for the GM so they have as little to worry about as possible, so the end scope is incredibly broad at this point

## Outline And Plan

This application will be made using the tkinter library, a first for me, due to my current interest in Python

I will first create a basic application that has the ability to create a campaign file with some basic info

Then I will make a "World Generator" that will create different aspects of the world, nations, subnations, towns/cities, how large each of them are and what other ones are nearby - this will include the ability to go up and down levels and select related articles from the current one
